    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:
        <blockquote>"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless."</blockquote>

        <h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Season Package:$95</li>
            <li>Patron Package:$200</li>
            <li>Single Speaker:$25</li>
        </ul>
